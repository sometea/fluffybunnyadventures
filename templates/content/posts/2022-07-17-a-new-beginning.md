On a sunny June morning two fluffy bunnies boarded a train from Cologne to Brussels. The train was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to Fluffy Bunny Adventures. But it was a beginning.

Boarding the train naturally led to boarding another train, and another, two nights in Glasgow, a train again, and a ferry. In the picture, one can see said ferry behind the Kisimul castle in Castlebay, Barra, the southernmost of the Outer Hebrides islads to the west of Scotland.
