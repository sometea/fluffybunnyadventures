From Venice, the railway took us to a city called Pescara on the Adriatic coast. It is the most populated city of the Abruzzo region. We did not spend much time in Pescara, as we advice you not to do either, but got out of town for a little walk close to the village of Popoli. We discovered a beautiful castle ruin and enjoyed the sunny landscape. We also stumbled upon a local cat gathering.
