Dear world-wide web,\
we send you these bits\
to remember this summer's wonderful trip.

To keep on this page\
memories of days\
back from a time when the world began to break.

Not everywhere -\
there still was clean air\
clean water and nature, but it was becoming rare.

The time had arrived\
with clear enough signs\
to make it difficult to close one's eyes.

Forests were lit\
as heatwaves hit\
and floodwaters crumbled homes into bits.

Privileged enough\
with money and stuff\
we took a train to Switzerland, the country of love.

Thus begins this tale,\
you may grab a beer (or ale)\
and journey through the pictures of our lovely mountain trail.

We trekked through snow,\
watched mountain rivers flow\
and skipped over stones where the water was low.

Landscapes we saw\
like paintings without flaw\
The nimble Alpine ibex left us in awe.

Glaciers shone blue\
and a fresh wind blew.\
From the top of the world you can have the clearest view.

The weather was mild,\
marmots lived in the wild,\
and everyone who passed us smiled.

We leave you with this,\
c'est la vie Suisse!\
Until the next adventure, our greetings and a kiss!

But we have a request:

Please don't be inspired to travel to Switzerland because of this blog post, and if you are determined to do it, please don't take an airplane. Please avoid flying anywhere. And since we're making requests, please don't eat animals.

We only have one planet, we have to do our best.
