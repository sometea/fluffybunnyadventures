We came across the ruins of old stone houses along the way. The light turned gloomy.

The rain stopped from time to time. In raincoats and wet shoes, we admired the rocky landscape of glens and lochs.

After wind, rain and sheep, the world around us turned quiet. Gray sky and gray water with a hint of blue.

Seagull oh,

what do thou say?

Wind brings thy cry

from yonder bay.
