We were now embarking on "the finest section of the Hebridian Way". It was guarded by a fierce sheep.

After being so windy, rainy, and full of sheep, the world around us at one point just turned quiet. Gray sky, gray water with a hint of blue.

The sheep however had started some sort of cult centred around the way poles.

We also discovered several old abandoned stone houses along the way. This one must have been haunted in ancient times. The light turned gloomy to underline the magic atmosphere when we looked at it.

Even though it still rained from time to time, there was no shortage of pretty sights when it stopped for a while.

On our way to Tarbert, we had several beautiful views of bays and fjords. At some point, we pitched our tent for the night in a spot that seemed dry and level enough.

After the comforts of the Backpacker's Stop hostel in Tarbert, it started getting stormy and rainy again and we could not find any good wild camping spot on the way to our next destination, Stornoway. Instead we hitch-hiked all the way there and put up the tent at the local campsite for the night. The next day, we took a bus to the Callanish Stones, an arrangement of standing stones erected in the late Neolithic era (around 5000 years ago).

There, we were greeted by a friendly hobbit who invited us to spend the night at their hobbit hole.

The fluffy bunnies are always on the move, even though their adventures never really end. Leaving Stornoway towards Ullapool on the main land by ferry on the following day, we were already plotting our next expedition.
