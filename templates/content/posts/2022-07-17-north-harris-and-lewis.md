We came across the ruins of old stone houses along the way. The light turned gloomy.

The rain stopped from time to time. In raincoats and wet shoes, we admired the rocky landscape of glens and lochs.

After wind, rain and sheep, the world around us turned quiet. Gray sky and gray water with a hint of blue.

After the comforts of the Backpacker's Stop hostel in Tarbert, it started getting stormy and rainy again and we could not find any good wild camping spot on the way to our next destination, Stornoway. Instead we hitch-hiked all the way there and put up the tent at the local campsite for the night. The next day, we took a bus to the Callanish Stones, an arrangement of standing stones erected in the late Neolithic era (around 5000 years ago).

There, we were greeted by a friendly hobbit who invited us to spend the night at their hobbit hole.

The fluffy bunnies are always on the move, even though their adventures never really end. Leaving Stornoway towards Ullapool on the main land by ferry on the following day, we were already plotting our next expedition.
