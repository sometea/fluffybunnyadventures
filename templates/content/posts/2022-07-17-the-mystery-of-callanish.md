The Isle of Lewis is home to the ancient Callanish stone cirle. Dating back 5000 years, it is older than Stonehenge. What its purpose was is a mystery. A site of worship? A prehistoric lunar observatory? A depiction of giant bunnies, with only the ears remaining? We shall never know.

We were greeted by a friendly hobbit who invited us to spend the night at their hobbit hole.

On the ferry from Stornoway to Ullapool on the main island, we were already plotting our next expedition.
