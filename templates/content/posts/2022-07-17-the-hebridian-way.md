After the next day's hike, due to the unfavorable weather conditions, we moved our hostel booking to one day in advance and called a taxi to get there ahead of schedule.

Hebridian bog!\
Hebridian rain!\
What joy it is to be dry again.

Glen, moor and sea,\
A sandy bay,\
A gushing wind and a rare sunray,\
A flock of sheep,\
White, black and gray,\
Will meet you on the Hebridian way.

On the next day the bus dropped us off a crossing where another beautiful section of the Hebridian way starts. We hiked for a about 4 hours through a pretty but also somewhat boggy area across a hill with a nice view across the surrounding lochs and the coast. We then continued on the tarmac road to the island of Berneray. We enjoyed a relaxing and sunny afternoon at the beach there before pitching our tent. The cows soon lost interest in us.
