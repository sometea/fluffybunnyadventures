Our next stop was Matera in the region of Basilicata. We also made a stop in Bari but we absolutely do not advise you to go there so we won't write anything about it.

In Matera, we got to enjoy the Sassi (cave dwellings), tasted some excellent local vegan cuisine, and went for a small hike on top of a hill with a nice view on the old part of the town.

We found that the main activity in Matera is going to viewpoints and viewing stuff. Very enjoyable.
