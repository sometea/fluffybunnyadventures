We left Cologne around 9am to take the train to Brussels, then the Eurostar through the channel tunnel to London, then the train to Glasgow. This works fine if one allows for enough buffer time at the Eurostar check-in (there is a security gate and a passport control, and sometimes there is a bit of a queue).

On arrival in Glasgow, we were greeted by Christoph waving from his window.
