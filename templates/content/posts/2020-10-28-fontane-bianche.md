Off-season, Fontane Bianche is very quiet. There are not many restaurants, and only two tiny supermarkets. Luckily they had our favourite Sicilian pistachio pesto. 

Our apartment was very close to the beach, so we took our books and deck chairs out to the beach and soaked up the sun, watching sailing boats go by in the distance. Even in the end of October, the sea was warm enough to swim. We discovered that the place is not very walker-friendly, one eventually runs into a highway, but we did find some nice paths along the cliffs and through lemon groves.
