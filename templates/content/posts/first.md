It is the beginning of October and the height of the Sturm season as the fluffy bunnies arrive in Vienna. We have been advised that this is the best time to visit the Austrian capital. "What is Sturm?", you may ask. It is a sweet and delicious drink of unfiltered, fermenting grape juice on its way to becoming wine. It is best enjoyed on a little hike through the wineyards around Vienna, on a sunny day and with good company.
