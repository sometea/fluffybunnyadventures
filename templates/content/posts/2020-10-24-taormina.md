Taormina is quite stunning, if you think about it (which we did). It is located on a hill overlooking a bay. A hill and bay in which we had three beautiful days to roam about and frolic. There is a nice walk/run up to the town of Castelmola, situated at a somewhat higher altitude. We also visited the ancient Greek amphitheatre, rebuilt by the Romans. Cactus fruit were abundant, and we took the opportunity to pick one. It was very seedy but moderately tasty and fresh. The beach was pretty too.
